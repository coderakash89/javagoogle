Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts (up to 90%), you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and other flexible tasks that can be interrupted. These can be terminated at short notice, so these are not suitable for critical workloads that need to run at a specific point in time.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon EC2 Pricing Options Overview:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt3-q56-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>On-Demand Instance</strong> - An On-Demand Instance is an instance that you use on-demand. You have full control over its lifecycle — you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed. On-demand instances cannot be interrupted. However, On-demand instances are not as cost-effective as spot instances, so this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reserved Instance (RI)</strong> - Reserved Instances (RI) provide you with significant savings (up to 75%) on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances (RI) are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance (RI) for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. Reserved instances (RI) cannot be interrupted. Reserved instances (RI) are not as cost-effective as spot instances, so this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dedicated Host</strong> - Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity, and elasticity of AWS. An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated for your use, so you can help address corporate compliance requirement. They're not cost-efficient compared to spot instances.

If you have large quantities of data you need to migrate into AWS, offline data transfer with AWS Snowball can overcome the challenge of limited bandwidth, and avoid the need to lease additional bandwidth. AWS Snowball moves terabytes of data in about a week. You can use it to move things like databases, backups, archives, healthcare records, analytics datasets, IoT sensor data and media content, especially when network conditions prevent realistic timelines for transferring large amounts of data both into and out of AWS.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Virtual Private Network (VPN)</strong> - A VPN connection refers to the connection between your Virtual Private Cloud and your on-premises network. By default, instances that you launch into an Amazon VPC can't communicate with your own (remote) network. You can enable access to your remote network from your VPC by creating an AWS Site-to-Site VPN (Site-to-Site VPN) connection, and configuring routing to pass traffic through the connection. VPN aids regular connectivity of AWS and your private om-premises network, it is not a data migration solution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Direct Connect</strong> - AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. You can use AWS Direct Connect to establish a private virtual interface from your on-premise network directly to your Amazon VPC, providing you with a private, high bandwidth network connection between your network and your VPC.

Amazon CloudFront makes your website files (such as HTML, images, and video) available from data centers around the world (called edge locations). When a visitor requests a file from your website, Amazon CloudFront automatically redirects the request to a copy of the file at the nearest edge location. This results in faster download times than if the visitor had requested the content from a data center that is located farther away.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon CloudFormation to improve the performance of your website</strong> - AWS CloudFormation allows you to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts. CloudFormation cannot be used to improve the performance of a static website.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) to improve the performance of your website</strong> - By using AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF), you can configure web access control lists (Web ACLs) on your CloudFront distributions or Application Load Balancers to filter and block requests based on request signatures.

Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.</p>\n\n<p>There are two types of VPC endpoints: interface endpoints and gateway endpoints.</p>\n\n<p>An interface endpoint is an elastic network interface with a private IP address from the IP address range of your subnet that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported service. Interface endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to privately access services by using private IP addresses.</p>\n\n<p>A gateway endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined to a supported AWS service.

AWS Trusted Advisor analyzes your AWS environment and provides best practice recommendations in five categories: Cost Optimization, Performance, Security, Fault Tolerance, Service Limits.</p>\n\n<p>AWS Trusted Advisor checks the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that were running at any time during the last 14 days and alerts you if the daily CPU utilization was 10% or less and network I/O was 5 MB or less on 4 or more days.</p>\n\n<p>How AWS Trusted Advisor Works:\n<img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/product-marketing/AWS%20Support/AWS-trusted-advisor.5b9909d5f29f680eeb12ccff536e8d88d8701304.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/\">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/</a></p>\n\n<p>How AWS Trusted Advisor identifies low utilization Amazon EC2 instances:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt3-q28-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/best-practice-checklist/#Cost_Optimization\">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/best-practice-checklist/#Cost_Optimization</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Cost Explorer</strong></p>\n\n<p>AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report that helps you visualize the costs and usage associated with your top five cost-accruing AWS services, and gives you a detailed breakdown of all services in the table view. The reports let you adjust the time range to view historical data going back up to twelve months to gain an understanding of your cost trends.</p>\n\n<p>The rightsizing recommendations feature in AWS Cost Explorer helps you identify cost-saving opportunities by downsizing or terminating Amazon EC2 instances. You can see all of your underutilized Amazon EC2 instances across member accounts in a single view to immediately identify how much you can save.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Cost &amp; Usage Report (AWS CUR)</strong> - The AWS Cost &amp; Usage Report (AWS CUR) contains the most comprehensive set of cost and usage data available. You can use AWS Cost &amp; Usage Report (AWS CUR) to publish your AWS billing reports to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that you own. You can receive reports that break down your costs by the hour or month, by product or product resource, or by tags that you define yourself. AWS Cost &amp; Usage Report (AWS CUR) cannot be used to identify under-utilized Amazon EC2 instances.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon CloudWatch</strong> - Amazon CloudWatch can be used to create alarm to monitor your estimated charges. When you enable the monitoring of estimated charges for your AWS account, the estimated charges are calculated and sent several times daily to CloudWatch as metric data. You can choose to receive alerts by email when charges have exceeded a certain threshold. Think resource performance monitoring, events, and alerts; think CloudWatch. Amazon CloudWatch cannot be used to identify under-utilized Amazon EC2 instances without manually configuring an alarm with the appropriate threshold to track the Amazon EC2 utilization, so this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Budgets</strong> - AWS Budgets gives the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. You can also use AWS Budgets to set reservation utilization or coverage targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you define. AWS Budgets can be created at the monthly, quarterly, or yearly level, and you can customize the start and end dates. You can further refine your budget to track costs associated with multiple dimensions, such as AWS service, linked account, tag, and others. AWS Budgets cannot be used to identify under-utilized EC2 instances without manually configuring coverage targets, so this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/best-practice-checklist/#Cost_Optimization\">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/best-practice-checklist/#Cost_Optimization</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/ce-rightsizing.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/ce-rightsizing.html</a></p>\n"}}]}
