Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.</p>\n\n<p>AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Fargate</strong></p>\n\n<p>AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

It is the easiest way to provision servers on AWS Cloud and access the underlying OS. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</strong> - AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services. You simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. Beanstalk provisions servers so it is not a serverless service.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Lightsail</strong> - Amazon Lightsail is an easy-to-use cloud platform that offers you everything needed to build an application or website, plus a cost-effective, monthly plan.

You have full control over its lifecycle — you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. There is no need for a long-term purchasing commitment.

Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts (up to 90%), you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and other flexible tasks that can be interrupted. These can be terminated at short notice, so these are not suitable for critical workloads that need to run at a specific point in time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reserved Instance (RI)</strong> - Reserved Instances (RI) provide you with significant savings (up to 75%) on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances (RI) are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance (RI) for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. Reserved instances (RI) cannot be interrupted. Reserved instances (RI) are not the right choice for short-term workloads.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dedicated Host</strong> - Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity, and elasticity of AWS.

Read replicas allow you to create read-only copies that are synchronized with your master database. Read replicas are used for improved read performance. You can also place your read replica in a different AWS Region closer to your users for better performance. Using a cross-Region read replica can also help ensure that you get back up and running if you experience a regional availability issue in case of a disaster.

When you provision an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention. Think of multi-AZ deployment as enhancing the availability and reliability of your system. For a disaster event based on disruption or loss of one physical data center, implementing a highly available workload in multiple Availability Zones within a single AWS Region helps mitigate against natural and technical disasters. So, RDS Multi-AZ can be used to address DR requirements.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Amazon RDS Multi-AZ with two readable standbys maximizes read-performance and scalability.</p>\n\n<p>To understand the Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) disaster recovery capabilities in more detail, you can refer to this excellent AWS blog:\n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/implementing-a-disaster-recovery-strategy-with-amazon-rds/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/implementing-a-disaster-recovery-strategy-with-amazon-rds/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>You can use read replicas for improved read performance only and multi-AZ deployment for disaster recovery only</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>You can use read replicas for disaster recovery only and multi-AZ deployment for improved read performance only</strong></p>\n\n<p>These two options contradict the details provided earlier in the explanation, so these options are incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You can use both read replicas and multi-AZ deployment having single standby for improved read performance</strong> - Amazon RDS Multi-AZ with single standby can only be used to enhance durability and availability.

These data resources are ready to serve requests. In addition to replication, this strategy requires you to create a continuous backup in the recovery Region.

The DR endpoint can handle requests, but cannot handle production levels of traffic. It may be more, but is always less than the full production deployment for cost savings.

Generally, two Regions are used. Each Region hosts a highly available, multi-Availability Zone (AZ) workload stack. In each Region, data is replicated live between the data stores and also backed up. This protects against disasters that include data deletion or corruption since the data backup can be restored to the last known good state. Each regional stack serves production traffic effectively. But, this strategy is cost involving and should only be used for mission-critical applications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pilot Light strategy</strong> - Pilot Light, like  Warm Standby strategy, replicates data from the primary Region to data resources in the recovery Region, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) DB instances or Amazon DynamoDB tables.

Pilot light requires you to first deploy infrastructure and then scale out resources before the workload can handle requests.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Backup &amp; Restore strategy</strong> - Backup and Restore is associated with higher RTO (recovery time objective) and RPO (recovery point objective). This results in longer downtimes and greater loss of data between when the disaster event occurs and recovery.

By default, new buckets, access points, and objects don't allow public access. However, users can modify bucket policies, access point policies, or object permissions to allow public access. S3 Block Public Access settings override these policies and permissions so that you can limit public access to these resources.</p>\n\n<p>When Amazon S3 receives a request to access a bucket or an object, it determines whether the bucket or the bucket owner's account has a block public access setting applied. If the request was made through an access point, Amazon S3 also checks for block public access settings for the access point. If there is an existing block public access setting that prohibits the requested access, Amazon S3 rejects the request.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon S3 Block Public Access Overview:\n<img src=\"https://javagoogle.com/assets/clfc02/pt4-q65-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Trigger a lambda function every time an object is uploaded on Amazon S3. The lambda function should change the object settings to make sure it stays private</strong> - Although it's possible to implement this solution, but it is more efficient to use the \"Amazon S3 Block Public Access\" feature as its available off-the-shelf.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon CloudWatch to ensure that all Amazon S3 resources stay private</strong> - Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service built for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and IT managers. CloudWatch provides data and actionable insights to monitor applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health. This is an excellent service for building Resilient systems. Think resource performance monitoring, events, and alerts; think CloudWatch. CloudWatch cannot be used to ensure data privacy on Amazon S3.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Set up a high-level advisory committee to review the privacy settings of each object uploaded into Amazon S3</strong> - This option has been added as a distractor.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html</a></p>\n"}}]}
