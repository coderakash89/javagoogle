The AWS encryption SDK is a client-side encryption library that is separate from the language–specific SDKs. You can use this encryption library to more easily implement encryption best practices in Amazon S3.

SSE-KMS also provides you with an audit trail that shows when your KMS key was used and by whom.</p>\n\n<p>Server-side encryption is the encryption of data at its destination by the application or service that receives it.

A Reserved Instance (RI) is not a physical instance, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account.

There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed.

Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts (up to 90%), you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and optional tasks.

You don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.</p>\n\n<p>Elastic Beanstalk is an example of a PaaS service. You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong> - SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software. AWS Rekognition is an example of a SaaS service.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Network as a Service (NaaS)</strong> - This is a made-up option and has been added as a distractor.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/</a></p>\n"}},{"questionId":36,"questionText":"A company needs a storage solution for a project wherein the data is accessed less frequently but needs rapid access when required.
